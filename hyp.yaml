# Hyperparameters for demanding maritime ship detection
# Geometric Augmentation
scale: 0.2    # Aggressive scaling down (from 0.2 to 1.5)
degrees: 15.0 # Increased rotation (up to +/- 15 degrees)
shear: 5.0    # Add some shear distortion (up to +/- 5 degrees)
perspective: 0.0005 # Small but non-zero perspective change

# Photometric Augmentation (HSV)
hsv_h: 0.1    # Increased Hue adjustment
hsv_s: 0.7    # Aggressive Saturation adjustment
hsv_v: 0.5    # Aggressive Brightness adjustment

# Advanced Augmentation
mosaic: 0.8   # High probability for mosaic
mixup: 0.1    # Non-zero probability for mixup
